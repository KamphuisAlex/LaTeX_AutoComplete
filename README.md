LaTeX AutoCompletions
=====================

Provides autocomplete files for editing LaTeX in Sublime Text.

Pressing '\' will open autocomplete popup (same als 'ctrl+space' would do) and insert a '\' so you can continue typing as you would normally.

Completions provided by this package may only work if you have included the LaTeX package they are defined in.

The list is auto-generated from cwl files using https://github.com/KamphuisAlex/latexautocompletions
